### Metadata

This directory contains metadata for the images in the series ["American Unofficial Collection of World War I Photographs, 1917-1918"](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/533461).

It includes: 
* the [raw metadata in JSON format](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Wartime-Films-Project/blob/master/ww1/metadata/165-ww-catalog-export.zip) exported from the [National Archives Catalog](https://catalog.archives.gov/)
* a CSV file generated by the app developers to capture additional metadata about events, regiments, thematic tags, etc., and latitudes and longitudes for images in the app

We encourage members of the public to enhance the CSV file with additional metadata to improve the accessibility of the images in the app.

This metadata can also be accessed through a call to the National Archives Catalog API: https://catalog.archives.gov/api/v1?&description.item.localIdentifier=165-WW
