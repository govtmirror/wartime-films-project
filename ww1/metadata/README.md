### Metadata

This directory contains metadata for the images in the series ["American Unofficial Collection of World War I Photographs, 1917-1918"](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/533461). This data was obtained from a full JSON export of [item-level results](https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=*:*&f.ancestorNaIds=533461&sort=naIdSort%20asc&f.level=item) under the series. The data was further refined by uploading it to Open Refine.

The app developers are enriching this data by parsing out events, regiments, thematic tags, and other data and adding lat-longs based on existing location information. We are posting the first iteration of a [CSV download of this data](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/wartime-films-project/blob/master/ww1/metadata/165-ww-catalog-metadata-for-Historypin.csv) so that others may further enhance it. 

Some big tasks that we are looking for help with are:
* Adding lat-longs based on the current description metadata.
* Adding topic keywords to the “Tags” column based on the current description metadata. We are putting together a master list of thematic tags that will ultimately help with discovery and browsing within the app, which you can view and add to here.
* Reformatting dates to match the yyyy, yyyy-yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd format required for upload to the app.

While we have already begun to enhance this data ourselves, we are posting it here to leverage the power of the crowd to further enhance it. We hope that you will participate in this effort by adding your own enhancements! Together we can improve the accessibility of the images in the app.

Metadata can also be accessed through [queries to the National Archives Catalog API](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Wartime-Films-Project/tree/master/ww1#national-archives-catalog-api).
