### Metadata

This directory contains metadata for the images in the series ["American Unofficial Collection of World War I Photographs, 1917-1918"](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/533461).

It includes the [raw data in JSON format](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Wartime-Films-Project/blob/master/ww1/metadata/165-ww-catalog-export.zip) exported from the [National Archives Catalog](https://catalog.archives.gov/) as well as a CSV file generated by the app developers to capture additional metadata about events, regiments, thematic tags, etc., and adding latitudes and longitudes based on existing location information for images included in the app.

We encourage members of the public to enhance the CSV file with additional metadata to improve the accessibility of the images in the app.
