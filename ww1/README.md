# Wartime Films Project - World War I

### App
The metadata posted and enriched on GitHub will feed into a U.S. National World War I app that will highlight NARA Wartime Films content, improving content discoverability and relevance for local audiences. The primary purpose of the app is to highlight NARA WWI content specific to the Wartime Films digitization and preservation effort, as well as WWI content contributed from other institutions and individuals, increasing the relevance and discovery of this content for local communities.  

The intention is to dedicate the codebase of this software to the public domain in the United States, in addition to waiving copyright and related rights in the work worldwide with a CC0 license. The codebase will be extended as needed. It will be published here on NARA’s GitHub for others to further modify and repurpose following the beta release of the app in the fall of 2016 (see [Terms of Use](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Wartime-Films-Project/blob/master/LICENSE)).

### Metadata

The photographic files contained in the series "American Unofficial Collection of World War I Photographs, 1917-1918" are a mesmerizing slice of American life during the years leading up to and after the U.S. involvement in WWI. The collection is richly described and in many instances contains geographic location information contained within titles or descriptions. Subjects include bonds, savings stamps and war loan drives, public gatherings, peace demonstrations and parades. Also documented are activities of libraries, hospitals, first aid stations, training camps and forts, and groups such as African-Americans in the military, Women's Suffrage activities, and much more.
